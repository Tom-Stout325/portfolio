            <p> My first project at ElevenFifty Academy was an assignment called CSS Creature.</p>
            <p>The CSS Creature was my first use of CSS and called for the creation of a creature, using only CSS.</p>
            <p>I chose to recreate a character that my daughter drew for me when she was 10 years old.  She was taking classes at an art school and was given the assignment of drawing a new cartoon character.</p>
            <p>That year, she and my wife had the character made into a stuffed animal, and gave it to me for Christmas.  My daughter wanted me to keep the character with me when I worked so it would keep me safe.  At the time I was a patrolman with IMPD, and kept the character with me for over 7 years while I worked patrol.  Given the current climate in our country, I chose to give the character a frown, rather than a smile.</p>

            <p> For our next project, Static Layout, were were tasked with creating a website that matched an existing site, using only HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>The Static Layout was an opportunity to style a larger amount of content, with the challenge of matching a professionally styled page.</p>
            <p>I chose to recreate a website, kast.com, which is a streaming service.</p>
            <p>This project provided an excellent opportunity to learn CSS customization, with expamples used by professional developers.</p>

            <p> My first project with ElevenFifty Academy was a guessing game.</p>
            <p>The Guessing Game was my first use of javascript and called for the creation of an input, validation, a result, and a count function.</p>
            <p>My take on the guessing game paid homage to a great movie that introduced the world to hackers and computer learning.  The movie, WarGames (1983), centered around a young man who was able to hack the pentagon War simulators, which he thought was a simple game.</p>
            <p> The movie is very entertaining and worth watching!  Check out the trailer here:

                <p> The next project was my first opportunity to work with an API.</p>
                <p>I called this project "Creative Minds"</p>
                <p>This project required the use of javascript and json objects and array, and finding a way to pull specific information for a massive list of options, then present the information in an attractive web page.</p>   
                <p>One of the most difficult things for photographers and artists to learn, is to see things creatively.  Most people will agree that something, like a flower, is pretty.  The goal for creatives is to find a way to see the same flower that everyone else sees, but in a way that they haven't seen it before.  Using things like angles, lighting, or color, artists can create an image of a common item that is different than people ordinarily see.
                </p>
                <p>This project was intended to allow people to search for creative inspiration from among millions of photos that have been shared by photographers.  By clicking the camera, the user can view an image, then click a button to generate another random image.

                <p> Our most recent project has been a deeper dive into the use of an API.</p>
                <p>The "Wallpaper" project expanded on the photography theme, and called for fetching specific and relevant data from an API, and using DOM manipulation to present the data in an attractive design.</p>
                <p>I worked with the Unsplash API to create an application that allows the user to search for images based on a keyword they enter.  The results bring a large number of images based on the keywords of the photographer.
                </p>
                <p>The theme of this project is to allow users to search a large database of images, based on specific criteria, to find amazing images that the user can download, and use as wallpaper for their devices. 
                </p>
                <p>My application, titled "Wallpaper Finder", relies on javascript functions to search json results from Unsplash, and present images that match criteria.  I also included buttons with keywords that I enjoy, as an opportunity for the user to get a feel for the type of photos available.  Once images are available from the fetch function, the user can then click on an image, and will be taken to the image's information page where they can download the image for their device, as well as see other related images.
